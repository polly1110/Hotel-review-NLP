# Hotel NLP

## Project Overview

In this project, I used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users are positive or negative and why. The dataset listed with real-world reviews posts from Booking.com. The dataset is hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe), originally The data was scraped from Booking.com, and originally owned by [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/).  This dataset contains 515,000 customer reviews and scoring of 1493 luxury hotels across Europe. I use Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the reviews, and  build Classification Models that aim to predict the emotion behind the reviews. I also perform various methods of data visualization and communication to convey findings and actionable insights.
